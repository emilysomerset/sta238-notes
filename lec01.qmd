## Sample Spaces and Events

A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.\
An **event** is a subset of the sample space.

Let $S$ be the sample space and $A \subseteq S$ be an event.

## Basic Probability Rules

-   $P(S) = 1$
-   $P(A) \geq 0$
-   If $A \cap B = \emptyset$ , then $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$
