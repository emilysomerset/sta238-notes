## Conditional Probability

The probability of ( A ) given ( B ) is:

$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} 
$$

## Bayes' Rule

$$ P(B_j \mid A) = \frac{P(A \mid B_j) P(B_j)}{\sum_k P(A \mid B_k) P(B_k)} $$

This allows us to reverse conditional probabilities based on known likelihoods and priors.
